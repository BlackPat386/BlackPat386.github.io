        <p>Freecodecamp Sacramento is a web development online community that delves into varoius topics such as HTML,
          CSS , Javascript, and Python etc. The groups goes in-depth on any given WebDev topic of the week and shows
          walkthroughs to accomplish certain tasks. Multiple attendees are able to collaborate and and give real-time
          feedback on these discussions</p>

        <br>
        <br>
        <p>The group meets every two weeks on Saturdays via zoom to discuss and collaborate on the topic of the week.
          This week in particular was Java, and while i don't have much experience in that area it was interesting to
          get a brief taste of programming languages. The meeting was very informative while the host was able to
          effectively broke down various Java concepts.</p>
