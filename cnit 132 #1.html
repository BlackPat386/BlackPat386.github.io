   <h3>Daytona Beach</h3>
<p>Daytona Beach is a moderately small beach town located in central florida. The allure that this town holds comes from it's ability to draw tourists from all over the country. A few of our major attractions in the area is the self proclaimed "World's most famous beach", Nascar's Daytona 500 race and the annual Bikeweek festival just to name a few.</p><br>

<p>Besides our plethora of fun attractions, Daytona beach offers many different cuisines. While we have a variety of dishes to satisfy any traveler or tourist, what really makes people flock to this town is our great seafood. A staple in our community when it comes to seafood is our Joe's crab shack that is situated on a pier that is off the coast of our beach.</p>
