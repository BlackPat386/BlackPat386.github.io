            Hello class my name Patrick Smith and this is my fourth-semester
            attending CCSF. I'm originally from Daytona Beach, Florida and
            have been residing in California for a little past two years.
            Previously before relocating to NorCal i was stationed in in San
            Diego for five years when i was enlisted in the military. While
            i'm currently finishing up requisites for my AS in Cisco
            networking i've always had a passion for learning additional
            facets of IT/CS such as coding. <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            Since a young age i have always been interested in specifically on
            the hardware side for example such as routers, PC's and cables. As
            i've started to become more knowledgable of the IT industry,coding
            and sofware development became more interesting. In 2021 i
            enrolled into CCSF to pursue a degree in computer networking and
            found it the perfect opportunity to enroll in a couple coding
            classes to become more familiar with software development. While i
            won't say that coding is my "forte",it is beneficial today to be
            familiar with the basics of HTML/CSS to have a competitive edge in
            today's tech market

        <p>
          As someone who's played a variety of sports from football,
          basketball, and track & field, ESPN is one of my personal favorite
          website. As an avid sports fan the ESPN website lets me conveniently
          stay up to date with all of my favorite teams and breaking news.
